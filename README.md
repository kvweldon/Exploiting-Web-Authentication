# Exploiting-Web-Authentication


<h1>Phase 6</h1>

*This lab is run utilizing the DVWA(Damn Vulnerable Web Application) to help facilitate brute force and dictionary attack examples. Logging in to first DVWA is necessary to access the various challenges.*

**<p style="font-size: 15px;">Step 1: Discovering web credentials with a dictionary attack.</p>**

To start, I opened Firefox, went to dvwa.structureality.com, and logged in. Below is the initial log in page and the home page of the site. In the real world, I would attempt to exploit any logon prompt I discovered.

I selected the Brute Force tab to begin the challenge. I took a guess at a username and password and entered, "jordan:123abc".

The username and password I entered were incorrect which resulted in the below error message along with the new URL.

"http://dvwa.structureality.com/vulnerabilities/brute/?username=jordan&password=123abc&Login=Login#"

In order to successfully brute force the site, I needed to obtain the PHPSESSID cookie. It is allows websites to store, communicate, and manage serialized state data and is discarded when a browser is closed. I right clicked on the web page and selected "inspect" to bring forth the web page inspector pane.

I then found the PHPSESSID, copied it, opened the Text Editor and pasted it. In a subsequent step, the PHPSESSID will be used in Hydra to perform a websession hijack. Utilizing the same session identifier allows Hydra to be seen as the original client by the web server. 

I then closed the web page inspector and opened the Terminal.

In the Terminal, I created two files with the potential usernames of root and admin by entering "echo root > users.txt" and "echo admin >> users.txt". I utilized the cat command to ensure the contents of the file was correct.

Kali includes a variety of password lists, and I entered " ls -l /usr/share/seclists/Passwords" to display them.

The UserPassCombo-Jay.txt file contains several of the passwords for the accounts on the DVWA site. I will utilize this file in my attacks.
